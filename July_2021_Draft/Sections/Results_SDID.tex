Nursing Home CON laws impose bureaucratic costs to nursing home providers by requiring those planning on opening a new nursing home or expanding a current facility to first show to a regulatory body that their region needs the service.  Propositions (\ref{prop1}), (\ref{prop2}), and (\ref{prop3}) predict that repealing nursing home CON will lead to an increase in nursing home quality, an increase in the access to nursing home services, and an increase in total and Medicaid nursing home expenditures, respectively. Based on the results of the model, therefore, we expect the repeal of NH-CON in PA, IN, and ND to result in an increased quantity of nursing homes and nursing home beds, as well as an increase in total and Medicaid nursing home expenditures in all three states.\footnote{Given the lack of historical data on the quality of nursing homes, only the impact on quantity and expenditures are analyzed in this study.}  Our empirical findings, the details of which are found in the next two subsections, are consistent with the predictions of our model in all instances where pre-treatment trends are parallel.

\subsection{Quantity of Nursing Homes and Nursing Home Beds}

\indent Table \ref{tab:ave_results_q_nh} reports the average estimated effect, $\hat{\tau}$ from equation (\ref{eq:ave_effect_deltas}), of dropping NH-CON regulations on the quantity of nursing homes per 100,000 in PA (Panel A), IN (Panel B), and ND (Panel C) using the DID, SC, and SDID estimators. According to our preferred estimates based on the SDID results, which in this case are very similar to the SC estimates, dropping NH-CON caused an increase of 0.43, 0.20, and 0.30 nursing homes per 100,000 in PA, IN, and ND, respectively. Also reported are the standard errors and 95\% confidence intervals derived using the placebo variance estimation approach outlined in Section \ref{sdid_inference}, which suggest that the SDID estimate for PA is statistically significant at the 5\% significance level and the estimate for IN is marginally significant. These estimated effects are quite large when compared to the average quantity of nursing homes per 100,000 over the pre-intervention period. For example, an increase of 0.43 nursing homes per 100,000 in PA is an increase of about 68.3 percent relative to its pre-intervention average of 0.63. Thus, these results show that the effect of nursing home CON on the quantity of nursing homes is not only consistent with our model, but also substantial and economically meaningful.  \\
\indent We will be showing similar graphs to Figures \ref{fig:q_nh_plots_pa} and \ref{fig: q_nh_spag_plots_pa} for each outcome variable and each treated state, so it will be helpful to describe in detail what each of these figures contain. The top panel of Figure \ref{fig:q_nh_plots_pa} shows trends in the quantity of nursing homes per 100,000 over time for PA and for the corresponding weighted average of controls states, with the time weights ($\hat{\lambda}$) used to average pre-treatment time periods at the bottom of the plots. The curved arrows in each of the plots represent the estimated average treatment effect that is reported in Table \ref{tab:ave_results_q_nh}. Recall that what the SDID estimator does is re-weight the untreated control states to make their time trend parallel, but not necessarily identical, to the treated state pre-treatment, then applies a DID analysis to this re-weighted panel. Moreover, because of the time weights, the SDID estimator only focuses on a subset of the pre-treatment time periods when carrying out this last step. These time periods are selected so that the weighted average of historical outcomes predict average treatment period outcomes for control states, up to a constant. The bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig:q_nh_plots_pa} show the state-by-state adjusted outcome difference $\hat{\delta}_{tr}-\hat{\delta}_i$ as specified in equations (\ref{eq:sc_deltas}), (\ref{eq:did_deltas}), and (\ref{eq:sdid_deltas}), with weights $\hat{\omega}_i$ indicated by dot size, and the weighted average of these differences - the same estimated effect $\hat{\tau}$ - indicated by the horizontal lines.\\
\indent Figure \ref{fig: q_nh_spag_plots_pa} provides some insights into our placebo variance estimation approach to conducting inference outlined in Section \ref{sdid_inference}. Specifically, the top panel of Figure \ref{fig: q_nh_spag_plots_pa} shows with what we will call ``spaghetti plots,'' the year-specific difference in the quantity of nursing homes per 100,000 between the treated state and its corresponding weighted average of control states for each of our estimators. The thick blue line shows these gaps for the actual treated state (PA in this case), and the thin pink lines show these gaps for each of the placebo control states used in the placebo variance estimation procedure outlined in Algorithm \ref{alg:two}. To facilitate a more meaningful comparison in how these gaps evolve over time, as well as a good way to visually assess parallel trends, we make the gaps in the DID and SDID plots relative to their value in the year prior to the treated state dropping NH-CON. We do not do this for the SC plot because the SC weights are chosen to match the treated state's actual levels, as opposed to making the trends just parallel (see Section \ref{did_sc_comp}). Not normalizing the gaps for the SC plot allows for a better assessment of the pre-treatment match between the actual treated state, or the placebo ``treated'' state, and its respective synthetic control. The plots in bottom panel of Figure \ref{fig: q_nh_spag_plots_pa} show the distribution of placebo estimates ($\hat{\tau}^{(b)}$ from Algorithm \ref{alg:two}), with the mean of the placebo estimates and the estimated effect for the actual treated state (PA in this case) indicated by the gray and blue vertical lines, respectively.\\  
\indent Figures \ref{fig:q_nh_plots_pa} -- \ref{fig: q_nh_spag_plots_nd} show for each treated state, these trend plots, state-by-state outcome differences $\hat{\delta}_{tr}-\hat{\delta}_i$, spaghetti plots, and placebo distribution plots for the quantity of nursing homes per 100,000 outcome. One consequential takeaway from these figures is that the unit weights used in SC and SDID estimation significantly improve pre-treatment similarities in the levels and trends of the treated states and their synthetic controls. Notice, for example, that for each state in Table \ref{tab:ave_results_q_nh}, the DID estimate is relatively larger than the SC and SDID estimates, particularly for IN. Figures \ref{fig:q_nh_plots_pa} -- \ref{fig: q_nh_spag_plots_nd} illustrate that this is a result of non-parallel pre-trends between the treated states (especially Indiana -- Figures \ref{fig:q_nh_plots_in} and \ref{fig: q_nh_spag_plots_in}) and their DID control group.\\
\indent A similar story emerges when we consider an alternative measure of access to nursing home services -- the quantity of nursing home beds per 100,000. Table \ref{tab:ave_results_q_nhb} reports the average estimated effect of dropping NH-CON regulations on this outcome for each of our three treated states and estimators. Figures \ref{fig:q_nhb_plots_pa} -- \ref{fig: q_nhb_spag_plots_nd} show analogous trend plots, state-by-state outcome differences and weights, spaghetti plots, and placebo distribution plots for this alternative measure of nursing home access. While the point estimates in Table \ref{tab:ave_results_q_nhb} are all positive, indicating that dropping NH-CON resulted in more nursing home beds available in the treated states, only the point estimates for Indiana are statistically significant. The spaghetti and placebo distribution plots in Figures \ref{fig: q_nhb_spag_plots_pa}, \ref{fig: q_nhb_spag_plots_in}, and \ref{fig: q_nhb_spag_plots_nd} illustrate that there is considerable noise in the placebo estimates, being in part driven by several extremely large placebo estimates.\footnote{\citet{abadie2010synthetic} discuss removing placebo units that, in the context of SC estimation, do not have a good fit in terms of mean-squared prediction error compared to that of the treated unit. When considering nursing home expenditure outcomes in the next section, we follow \citet{abadie2010synthetic} in dropping Washington DC from the analysis because we could not find anything remotely close to a good control group (in terms of pre-treatment levels and parallel trends). While it is clear that some placebo states had non-parallel pre-trends and a poor SC fit in our analysis of the quantity of nursing home beds, we chose to include them to be conservative and transparent, despite the resultant larger estimated variance and standard errors.}

\subsection{Total and Medicaid Nursing Home Expenditure}

Because a large majority of nursing home consumers are covered by government programs (primarily Medicaid) where prices are relatively inflexible, the increase in the quantity of nursing homes and beds  as a result of dropping NH-CON demonstrated in the previous section would be expected to result in an increase in total and Medicaid expenditures on nursing home services (Proposition \ref{prop3}). Table \ref{tab:ave_results_tot_exp} reports the average estimated effect of dropping NH-CON on total per capita nursing home expenditure. Our SDID estimate suggests that, in PA, dropping NH-CON caused an increase of about \$102 in total per capita nursing home expenditure, a 28.2 percent increase relative to the pre-intervention mean of \$361.02. Here again we see that the parallel trends assumption likely does not hold for our DID estimate (see the non-parallel pre-trends in the DID plots in Figures \ref{fig:tot_exp_plots_pa} and \ref{fig: tot_exp_spag_plots_pa}), resulting in a biased-upward estimate. We find no evidence that total expenditure was affected by dropping NH-CON in IN. While the point estimates for ND are all positive, only the SC estimate is statistically significant based on our placebo variance estimation and resulting standard errors and confidence intervals.\\
\indent Table \ref{tab:ave_results_med_exp} reports the average estimated effect of dropping NH-CON on per capita Medicaid nursing home expenditure. The point estimates in Panel A suggest that the increase in total per capita expenditure resulting from dropping NH-CON in PA is being driven almost entirely by an increase in Medicaid spending as a result of dropping NH-CON. Our SDID estimate suggests that, in PA, dropping NH-CON caused an increase in per capita Medicaid nursing home expenditure of about \$92, an increase of roughly 63 percent relative to the pre-period mean of \$145.56. Figures \ref{fig:med_exp_plots_pa} and \ref{fig: med_exp_spag_plots_pa} instill confidence based on pre-trends, that the control groups represent a good counterfactual trajectory for PA. Figure \ref{fig: med_exp_spag_plots_pa} also shows that the estimated effect on Medicaid expenditure in PA is larger than every one of the SDID placebo estimates, and all but one SC placebo estimate. While the point estimates in Panel B of Table \ref{tab:ave_results_med_exp} are positive, noen are statistically significant. Moreover, Figures \ref{fig:med_exp_plots_in} and \ref{fig: med_exp_spag_plots_in} show that this increase is being driven in large part by a spike at the end of the sample period in IN, well after they dropped NH-CON. Interestingly, 

\indent Figures \ref{fig:q_nursing_homes_trends} and \ref{fig:q_nursing_home_beds_trends} show trends in the quantity of nursing homes and nursing home beds per 100,000, respectively, in PA, IN, and ND and their corresponding synthetic controls. The quantity of nursing homes and beds per 100,000 in PA, IN, and ND and their corresponding synthetic controls are virtually identical up until they dropped nursing home CON regulations, at which point there is a clear divergence with the quantities in the states that dropped nursing home CON increasing relative to their synthetic controls. Recall from Section \ref{empirical_strategy} that we only used the first half of the pre-intervention years to form the synthetic matches using our outcome variable, and reserved the second half for out-of-sample validation. Despite only matching on the first half of the pre-intervention period, the outcomes in each state match their synthetic control extremely well in the second half of the pre-intervention period as well, instilling confidence that the synthetic controls replicate well the respective counterfactual trajectories of PA, IN, and ND in the post-intervention period.\\
\indent The year-specific effects of dropping NH-CON regulations on the quantity of nursing homes and beds, $\hat{\alpha}_{it}$ from equation (\ref{eq:year_spec_effect}), are shown graphically in Figures \ref{fig:q_nursing_homes_gaps} and \ref{fig:q_nursing_home_beds_gaps}, respectively. Also shown in these figures are the year-specific placebo effects for the states in the donor pool of potential control states, allowing for a visual inspection of how large the year-specific effects are in the treated states in comparison to the distribution of placebo effects. Our findings indicate that dropping NH-CON caused an immediate increase in the quantity of nursing homes per 100,000 in all three states with a subsequent gradual increase in PA and IN, and levelling off in ND. While there is less of an initial immediate increase, especially in PA and IN, a similar pattern emerges for the quantity of nursing home beds as shown in Figure \ref{fig:q_nursing_home_beds_gaps}. The year-specific effects in the treated states, especially PA and IN, appear to be relatively large when compared to the the distribution of year-specific placebo effects.\\
\indent Columns (3) and (4) of Table \ref{tab:ave_results} report the average annual effects, $\bar{\alpha}_1$ from equation (\ref{eq:ave_effect}), of dropping nursing home CON regulations on the quantity of nursing homes and beds per 100,000, respectively. Dropping nursing home CON caused an increase of 0.37, 0.28, and 0.21 nursing homes per 100,000 in PA, IN, and ND, respectively. The exact p-values corresponding to these estimates are 0.083 for PA, 0.028 for IN, and 0.472 for ND, suggesting that only the estimates in PA and IN are statistically significant at any reasonable significance level. These estimated effects are quite large when compared to the average quantity of nursing homes per 100,000 over the pre-intervention period. For example, an increase of 0.37 and 0.28 nursing homes in PA and IN is an increase of about 58.7 and 44.4 percent relative to their pre-intervention averages of 0.63. We find a similar positive effect on the quantity of nursing home beds per 100,000 in all three states, with the effect being largest and statistically significant in IN.\\
\indent Figures \ref{fig:tot_exp_trends} and \ref{fig:medicaid_exp_trends} show trends in total government nursing home and Medicaid expenditure per capita, respectively. Similar to the quantity trends, we find that our synthetic controls do a great job of matching PA despite only matching in the first half of the pre-intervention period, but do not match ID and ND as well. There's a clear divergence in total and Medicaid expenditure per capita after nursing home CON is dropped in PA, with total expenditure growing much faster in PA than in its synthetic control, and Medicaid expenditure increasing dramatically, especially initially, while Medicaid expenditure would have remained relatively stagnant had it not dropped NH-CON. Figures \ref{fig:tot_exp_gaps} and \ref{fig:medicaid_exp_gaps}, which show the year-specific effects in PA, IN, and ND and the placebo effects of dropping NH-CON on total and Medicaid nursing home expenditure, tell  the same story, and suggest that total and Medicaid expenditure increased dramatically in PA relative to the distribution of placebo effects, but the impact on ID and ND are insignificant.\\
\indent Columns (1) and (2) of Table \ref{tab:ave_results} report the average annual effects of dropping Nursing home CON on total and Medicaid nursing home expenditure per capita. Interestingly, the estimates of the effect on Medicaid expenditure are negative in both IN and ND, and also on total expenditure in IN. The p-values associated with the effect on Medicaid expenditures in IN and ND is very large suggesting no statistically significant effect of dropping nursing home CON on total or Medicaid expenditure in IN or ND. In contrast, we find large and statistically significant effects of dropping NH-CON on total and Medicaid expenditure per capita in PA. We estimate that dropping nursing home CON caused total nursing home annual expenditure to increase by \$123.57 per capita, an increase of about 35.3 percent relative to the average pre-intervention total expenditure of \$361 per capita. Most of this increase in total nursing home expenditure was in the form of increased nursing home Medicaid expenditure. We estimate that dropping NH-CON caused nursing home Medicaid expenditure to increase by \$104.17 per capita, an increase of about 71.6 percent relative to the average pre-intervention nursing home Medicaid expenditure of \$145.56 per capita.
